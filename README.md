## About 

This is the repository containing the code presented in the paper submitted to FRONTIERS [ TODO a link] 


## Organisation of the repository 

 -  directory model contains XXXX
 -  directory experiments contains YYY
 -  directory results contains a sample of simulation results



## Model 

### Software requirements

The model is built in Netlogo , version XXX and requires the following extensions : 
- `csv` is used to load trees data (e.g. `sebangau.csv` file)  and the various scenario of burnt forest 
- `nw` is used for the pathfinding utility function of the orangutan agent in the tree network 
- `rnd` is used for a weighted sampling utility function


For the model to work properly within OpenMOLE, the extensions directories have to be in the same directory than the `BORNEO-ABM.nlogo` model 

### Running the model 

1. Launch Netlogo version XXX
2. open the `BORNEO-ABM.nlogo` model via the menu `File>Open`
3. 



## Experiments
